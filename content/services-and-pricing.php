<p><b>Note 1</b><br>
We purchase computer components—for the most part—from <a href="https://newegg.com">Newegg</a>.  Parts totals include sales tax.  
    We do not work with custom liquid cooling systems nor parts from certain maufacturers.<br>
Software installation and setup is also available for an additional fee.<br>
Bootable flashdrives available for an additional fee.
</p>
<p><b>Note 2</b><br>
The price for data recovery is affected by few different difficulty factors.<br>
The m₿0.75 fee is for examination of the hard drive and prognosis.<br>
If the oporating system is hosed, then We need to use forensics tools, adding time and complexity.<br>
If the filesystem is hosed, then all recovered files are carved—meaning they lack a file name or file path.<br>
If the computer is a laptop, extracting the hard drive requires more effort.<br>
If the hard drive uses PATA or SCSI, We may need to purchase additional equipment.  (only very old computers)<br>
Data will be delivered to you on a flash drive or USB external hard drive, so more than 8 GB of recovered material could get increasingly expensive.<br>
<br>
We will give you a quote or tell you the disk is broken at a hardware level after an initial examination.  It is then up to you to decide if my price and time estimate are worth it to you.  
If the disk is broken at a hardware level, though I cannot recover data, data may still be recoverable by a forensic specialist.
