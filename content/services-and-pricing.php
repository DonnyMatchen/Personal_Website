<p><b>Note 1</b><br>
We purchase computer components—for the most part—from <a href="https://newegg.com">Newegg</a>.  Parts totals include shipping and sales tax. 
We do not work with custom liquid cooling systems nor parts from certain manufacturers.<br>
Software installation and setup is also available for an additional fee.<br>
Bootable flashdrives available for an additional fee.
</p>
<p><b>Note 2</b><br>
The price for data recovery is affected by a few different difficulty factors.<br>
The m₿0.75 fee is for examination of the hard drive and prognosis.<br>
If the operating system is hosed, we need to use forensics tools, adding time and complexity.<br>
If the filesystem is hosed, all recovered files are will be carved—meaning they lack a file name or file path.<br>
If the computer is a laptop, extracting the hard drive is trickier.<br>
If the hard drive uses PATA or SCSI, We may need to purchase additional equipment.  (only very old computers still have PATA and SCSI)<br>
Data will be delivered to you on a flash drive or USB external hard drive, so more than 8 GB of recovered material could get increasingly expensive.<br>
<br>
We will give you a quote or tell you the disk is broken at a hardware level after the initial examination.  
If the disk is broken at a hardware level, though we cannot recover data, data may still be recoverable by a forensic specialist.
</p>
<p><b>Note 3</b><br>
Our price for helping you select the right computer systems for your business is a m₿3 base price and m₿0.5 per computer user.  
For example, if you are buying computers for a department of 10 people, we will charge m₿8 (m₿3 + 10 × m₿0.5).
