<p><b>Note 1</b><br>
I purchase computer components--for the most part--from <a href="https://newegg.com">Newegg</a>.  Parts totals include sales tax.  I do not work with custom liquid cooling systems.<br>
Software isntallation and setup is also available for an additional fee.
</p>
<p><b>Note 2</b><br>
The fee for data recovery comprises a few different difficulty factors.<br>
The m₿0.75 fee is for examination of the hard drive.<br>
If the oporating system is hosed, then I need to use forensics tools.<br>
If the filesystem is hosed, then all recovered files are carved--meaning they lack a file name or file path.<br>
If the computer is a laptop, extracting the hard drive is more difficult.<br>
If the hard drive uses PATA or SCSI, I may have to purchase additional equipment.  (only very old computers)<br>
Data will be delivered to you on a flash drive or USB external hard drive, so more than 8 GB of recovered material could get increasingly expensive.<br>
<br>
I will give you a quote or tell you the disk is broken at a hardware level after an initial examination.  It's then up to you to decide if my price and time estimate are worth it to you.  If the disk is broken at a hardware level, though I cannot recover data, it does not mean the data is perminantly lost, it just means things get more expensive.
